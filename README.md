My personal website 

This website started as a project after completing some basic Python courses.

I watched a few tutorials to initialize my website using Flask and experimented using different routes and tested them locally.

I then started experimenting with HTML, CSS, and eventually, JavaScript to build more interactive components. StackOverflow and a bit of fiddling with my code on Copilot helped me get these features working properly.

I purchased a domain name on Namecheap and eventually hosting on Bluehost. I didn't use any of the WordPress features and instead uploaded my files onto the file manager so I would have complete control over the front-end aspects.

There is a lot more to improve. I've put this project on hold temporarily to work on some more urgent things.
